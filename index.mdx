## What is Canvas?

Canvas is two things:

**1. A GTM AI agent**: Describe what you want to build in plain English.
Canvas writes production-ready Typescript code and executes it.

**2. A GTM SDK**: Company data, People Data, Contact info, LinkedIn, GTM research:
all behind one import. One API. Type-safe TypeScript.

Think Claude Code, but tools purpose-built for GTM.

## Quick Example

```typescript
// Find fintech companies and their CTOs

const companies = await canvas.companies.find({
  industries: ["Fintech"],
  employeeCountMin: 50,
  employeeCountMax: 500,
  limit: 100,
});

const people = await canvas.people.search({
  companies,
  titles: ["CTO", "VP Engineering"],
  maxPerCompany: 2,
});

const contacts = await canvas.contacts.enrich({
  people,
});

return contacts;
```

**Example Output:**

| Name           | Company | Title          | Email             | Phone             |
