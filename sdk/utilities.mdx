The SDK provides utility functions for logging output and controlling execution flow.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `canvas.log(...args)` | Log output (captured in execution results) |
| `canvas.delay(ms)` | Wait for specified milliseconds |

---

## canvas.log()

Log messages that are captured and returned in the execution results. Use this instead of `console.log()` to see output in the workflow UI.

### Parameters

<ParamField body="args" type="...unknown[]" required>
  Any values to log. Objects are automatically stringified.
</ParamField>

### Example

```typescript
canvas.log("Starting workflow...");
canvas.log("Found", companies.length, "companies");
canvas.log({ step: "complete", count: 42 });
```

<Tip>
Use `canvas.log()` liberally during development to debug your workflows. All logs are captured and displayed in the execution results.
</Tip>

## canvas.delay()

Pause execution for a specified time. Useful for rate limiting or waiting between API calls.

### Parameters

<ParamField body="ms" type="number" required>
  Milliseconds to wait. Maximum is 10,000 (10 seconds).
</ParamField>

### Example

```typescript
// Wait 2 seconds between API calls
for (const company of companies) {
  const result = await canvas.ai.research({
    prompt: "Summarize this company",
    data: company
  });
  
  await canvas.delay(2000); // Wait 2 seconds
}
```

<Warning>
The maximum delay is 10 seconds. Longer delays will be capped to prevent runaway executions.
</Warning>

## Debugging Tips

### Log Progress

```typescript
const companies = await canvas.companies.find({
  industries: ["Fintech"],
  limit: 50,
});
canvas.log(`✓ Found ${companies.length} companies`);

const people = await canvas.people.search({
  companies,
  titles: ["CTO"],
});
canvas.log(`✓ Found ${people.length} people`);

const contacts = await canvas.contacts.enrich({ people });
canvas.log(`✓ Enriched ${contacts.length} contacts`);

return contacts;
```

### Log Data Samples

```typescript
// Log first item to inspect structure
canvas.log("Sample company:", companies[0]);

// Log specific fields
canvas.log("Industries found:", companies.map(c => c.industry).filter(Boolean));
```

### Track Timing

```typescript
const startTime = Date.now();

// ... do work ...

const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
canvas.log(`Completed in ${elapsed}ms`);
```
