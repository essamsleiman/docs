The Canvas SDK provides a clean, typed interface for building data enrichment workflows. Instead of managing multiple providers and APIs, you write simple code that just works. Our SDK supports:

- **B2B company discovery:** Find companies by industry, size, tech stack
- **Local business search:** Restaurants, stores, services via Google Maps
- **People search:** Decision makers by title, department, seniority
- **Contact enrichment:** Verified emails and phone numbers via waterfall across top data sources
- **LinkedIn & Instagram:** Scrape profiles, posts, and engagement data
- **AI research:** Summarize, analyze, and generate with multiple models

All powered by best-in-class data providers (Apollo, People Data Labs, Google Maps, Perplexity, and more) unified behind one typed API. 

## Design Philosophy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Task-Oriented" icon="list-check">
  Methods organized by what you want to accomplish: find people, enrich contacts, research companies.
</Card>

<Card title="Single Params Object" icon="brackets-curly">
  Every method takes one typed params object. No positional arguments to remember.
</Card>

<Card title="Smart Defaults" icon="wand-magic-sparkless">
  SDK picks the best provider automatically. Override with `_provider` when needed.
</Card>

<Card title="Type Safety" icon="shield-check">
  Full TypeScript support with autocomplete and compile-time error checking.
</Card>

## Explore the SDK

<Card title="People & Contacts" icon="users" href="/sdk/find-people">

Find decision makers at companies, then get their verified emails and phone numbers.

```typescript
const people = await canvas.people.search({
  companies,
  titles: ["CTO", "VP Engineering"],
});

const contacts = await canvas.contacts.enrich({ people });
```

</Card>

<Card title="Companies" icon="building" href="/sdk/find-companies">

Discover B2B companies by industry, size, and tech stack.

```typescript
const companies = await canvas.companies.find({
  industries: ["Fintech"],
  employeeCountMin: 50,
  employeeCountMax: 500,
});
```

</Card>

<Card title="Places" icon="location-dot" href="/sdk/find-places">

Find local businesses via Google Maps — restaurants, retail stores, service providers.

```typescript
const restaurants = await canvas.places.find({
  query: "Italian restaurants",
  location: "Austin, TX",
  minRating: 4.0,
});
```

</Card>

<Card title="Social" icon="linkedin" href="/sdk/linkedin">

Scrape LinkedIn profiles, get recent posts, find engaged prospects from reactions.

```typescript
const profiles = await canvas.linkedin.profiles({
  urls: ["linkedin.com/in/johndoe"],
});

const posts = await canvas.linkedin.posts({
  urls: ["linkedin.com/in/johndoe"],
  maxPosts: 10,
});
```

</Card>

<Card title="Enrichment" icon="brain" href="/sdk/ai-research">

Enrich records with AI-generated summaries, categorization, and research.

```typescript
const summary = await canvas.ai.research({
  prompt: "Summarize this company in one sentence",
  data: company,
});
```

</Card>

## Data Flow

Every code block receives `input` (data from the previous step) and must `return` an array (data for the next step).

```typescript
// input: Array of companies from previous step
// Add AI-generated summaries to each company
for (const company of input) {
  company.summary = await canvas.ai.research({
    prompt: "Summarize this company in one sentence",
    data: company,
  });
}

return input; // Pass enriched data to next step
```

<Card title="Learn more about Context" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/sdk/context">
  Understand input, output, and how data flows through workflows.
