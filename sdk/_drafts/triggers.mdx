Triggers define what starts your workflow. When an event fires, your code runs with the event data in `input`.

## Calendly

Trigger workflows when someone books a meeting.

```typescript
// input: Calendly booking data
const booking = input[0];

// Available fields
const { 
  name,           // "John Smith"
  email,          // "john@company.com"
  company,        // "Acme Inc" (if collected)
  event_type,     // "Demo Call"
  scheduled_time, // "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  answers,        // Custom question responses
} = booking;

// Enrich and process
const contacts = await canvas.contacts.enrich({
  people: [{ email, name }],
});

return contacts;
```

### Setup

1. Connect your Calendly account in Canvas settings
2. Select which event types trigger the workflow
3. Map custom questions to fields (optional)

---

## Webhooks

Receive data from any external system.

```typescript
// input: Webhook payload (your external system's data)
const payload = input[0];

// Process however you need
const contacts = await canvas.contacts.enrich({
  people: payload.leads,
});

return contacts;
```

### Setup

1. Create a webhook trigger in your workflow
2. Copy the unique webhook URL
3. Configure your external system to POST to that URL

### Webhook URL Format

```
https://app.canvas.com/api/webhooks/{workflow_id}
```

---

## Scheduled

Run workflows on a recurring schedule.

```typescript
// input: Empty array (no trigger data)
// Scheduled workflows generate their own data

const companies = await canvas.companies.find({
  industries: ["SaaS"],
  limit: 50,
});

return companies;
```

### Schedule Options

| Schedule | Cron | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Hourly | `0 * * * *` | Every hour |
| Daily | `0 9 * * *` | Every day at 9am |
| Weekly | `0 9 * * 1` | Every Monday at 9am |
| Monthly | `0 9 1 * *` | First of month at 9am |

## File Upload

Trigger with uploaded CSV/Excel data.

```typescript
// input: Array of rows from uploaded file
const rows = input;

// Each row is an object with column headers as keys
// { "Name": "John", "Email": "john@co.com", "Company": "Acme" }

const contacts = await canvas.contacts.enrich({
  people: rows.map(row => ({
    name: row.Name,
    email: row.Email,
  })),
});

return contacts;
```

### Supported Formats

- CSV (`.csv`)
- Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`)

---

## Manual

Run on-demand by clicking "Run" in the UI.

```typescript
// input: Empty array or test data you provide
const companies = await canvas.companies.find({
  industries: ["Fintech"],
  limit: 10,
});

return companies;
```

Good for testing and one-off runs.
